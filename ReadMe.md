# Evac All for XCOM2 War of the Chosen

## Note

This mod is for the War of the Chosen expansion only. For XCOM2 and Long War 2,
use the original Evac All mod.

## Description

This mod adds an "Evac All" ability to soldier ability bars when they are
in an active evac zone. Clicking this button will evac all soldiers 
currently in the evac zone instead of needing to click the evac button
on each individual soldier. 

Soldiers not in the evac zone will remain, exactly as before - this mod
doesn't add any gameplay change, it's purely an interface change.

This mod is compatible with existing saves, but will not take effect
until the next time you begin a mission after installing the mod. Loading
a saved game in-mission from before the installation will work, but no
Evac All ability will appear until the next mission.

## Installation

For manual installation, unzip the installation package into your XCOM2\XComGame\Mods folder 
(create the Mods folder if it doesn't exist).

## Configuration

This mod supports the Mod Config Menu mod for in-game configuration. If this mod is not
installed, configuration options can be set in the XComEvacAll_WotC_Defaults.ini file in
the mod's config folder.

The mod has two configurable options:

DisableEvacAnimation - Defaults to false (off). When set, using Evac All will cause all units
in the evac zone to instantly evac with no animation.

DisableNoEvacTileOverlay - Defaults to false (off). When set, disables the red "no-evac" tile
overlays that are painted over tiles in the evac zone that are blocked. Soldiers standing on
blocked tiles cannot evac, but there is no UI to indicate this in vanilla. You can turn off
the UI hint in this mod with this option.
